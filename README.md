1b. Very simple app that allows you to play it by clicking a generate button.
This generate button then generates a word and its' associated definition from a list.
For testing purposes, the list contains 10 words and the generate button generates it

1c. It's VCS is Github.com and Github Desktop which utilizes git in a much easier to follow fashion and less stress with pushing and committing changes.
